thoughts about inc:
C & C++'s include functions have been the subject of much discourse over the past years. Many people have tried to faze out the include by substituting it with import keywords (such as python & javascript).
That's good for them, it works fine. When you want to use something, you just import it and everything is okay.
I, personally, like include for its ease of use when importing libraries without classes.
In all fairness, I've never use python's import system, so maybe it's great! I just don't know.
Either way, my inc system will work like the following:
1) inc is found
2) string is looked for in the next token
3) once found, it is checked if it has been parsed yet
4) if it has, go to step 6
5) parse file
6) include all public functions and groups

man, it's been a while since i've typed in the dev log. Long time no see as they would say. Either way, here's what I've got to share. Of course after all this time, I've realized that making a programming language is hard, but the mere existance of arrays is like a sharp knife in my chest. Not that I hate them, no, in fact I love them! The thing that trips me up about them is that I have no idea how to add them to my language. There is also no documentation online about this and when I tried to see what C does, it just optimizes it out and doesn't show me anything. When I turn optimization off, it still doesn't show me the array indexing and declaration. One thing I did glean was the (data) tag, but I have no idea how that works. I should probably look into it ngl... XD aight I guess imma do that.
Ok i tried to look into it but there's nothing to see.
